AND GAVE US NOTHING. WE FEEL DUMB, BUT PLAN TO TRACK DOWN THIS PIECE OF

CLUB! SINGER, WHEEL CHER DEBUTED "TENNIS GRANNIE" (FIRST TIME THIS SIDE
OF THE ATLANTIC!), WHICH IS KINDA TOO SCARY TO EVEN GO INTO. ALSO IN A
MOMENT OF DIVINE INSPIRATION WHEEL CHER AND GUITARIST, BACK-SLASH,
INVENTED THE "ELECTRIFIED ANUS"!!! YES, THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS, WHEEL
CHER'S BUTTHOLE CONNECTED TO A MARSHALL STACK TURNED TO 11. SOMETHING
