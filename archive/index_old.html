Man, I can't even keep up with these crazy fucks anymore. Lineup changes, legal battles, blowout parties, something about a dog, or maybe a cockatoo... the details are hazy. Probably from the smoke. You know... from the FIRE under your ASS. Or maybe that's just me and my taco bell issues. Moving right along...    
<br>
<br>
The trip to Seattle was apparently a raging success. Kickass show: check. Record some of what Bill Clinton might call "the dope shit" with Jack Endino at the controls: check. Aging punk rockers having meetings while other punk rockers lay back like button men for the Gambinos, except without any of the money, glamour, or references to cannoli: check check check. Man, what more could you ask for?
<br>
<br>
How about some <a href="/new_shit.html">fucking SHOWS</a>, you say? Even that has some drama attached. (I just want to say I love the names the punk scene comes up with for the regular denizens, by the way. It's like a rogue's gallery of the mentally challenged. Got to love it.) Anyway, apparently the Grannnies will be pissing off some of the local swells by playing this next gig. Is that in and of itself surprising? Not if you've seen one of their shows. But the weird thing is, this time it <i> wouldn't</i> be because of their <i>music</i>. Or even their penchant for setting stuff (guitars, accessories, stage hands, etc.) on fire, aka "the act," aka aka "felonious tomfoolery." Is it because maybe some people may or may not really need to step back, take a deep breath, and say "I'm okay just the way I am, and the Grannies will love me anyway?"
<br>
<br>
 Maybe.
